# Files and modules

In the **Hamilton** sidebar, you'll find the **Python files** and the **Modules** sections.

**Python files** will list `.py` files from the workspace. Hover on an item and click the `Register module` icon. The file should now appear in the **Modules** section. They can be unregistered by clicking the `Unregister module` icon.

**Modules** will display the functions found in the registered Python files (excluding those with `_` prefix). This view is refreshed on file edits and items can be clicked to navigate to their definition. The registered modules are used for other extension features such as DAG visualization and results preview.
